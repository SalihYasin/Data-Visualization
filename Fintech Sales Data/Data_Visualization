# Fintech Sales Data
## An SQL Data Visualization Project
### by salihyasincetin@hotmail.com

In this project, I will visualize the data set given to me with the help of appropriate SQL and PowerBI.

These data sets contain information about the sales of the Fintech company. We want to restructure and visualize data in a more organized and useful way.

1. Reviewing Incoming Job Request
2. Determining Tasks Required for the Job
3. Extracting and Formatting Necessary Data from the Dataset
4. Constructing the Data Tree
5. Adding New Dimensions to the Table
6. Data Visualization
7. Creating a Presentation for the Employer

Among the 20 csv files sent to us, I chose 4 csv files and 1 excel file. Then, with the help of SQL, I extracted the columns I needed from these tables and brought them into the format we will use.

After all these procedures, we can now switch to the PowerBI application and transfer our files there.

We have 4 tables. First, we need to create a data tree between these tables. Here's what the tables and columns I linked look like:

Dım customers . Customer key --> fact_ınternetsales . Customer key 

Dım products . Product key --> fact_ınternetsales . Product key 

Dım calender . Date --> fact_ınternetsales . Orderdatekey 

Dım calender.date --> Fact_Budget.date
