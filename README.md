# DATA VISUALIZATION

 ## Introduction

This project was prepared to give other users an idea about how I can organize data, clean unnecessary data, and visualize data using SQL and PowerBI. Feel free to explore scenarios and adapt them to your own projects. Contributions and feedback are welcomed!

 ### Project List:
- Fintech InternetSales Data
- Fintech Products Data
- Fintech Customers Data
- Fintech Calendar Data

   ## Problem Statement
In data analysis, after the analyst cleans and organizes the data as it should be, he must turn this data into easily understandable visual presentations to present it to the necessary people or companies.

In this project, the procedures that should be suitable for the relevant data set and that I applied are as follows:

- Reviewing Incoming Job Request
- Determining What Needs To Be Done Regarding The Job
- Selecting The Necessary Data From The Data Set And Formatting It Appropriately
- Creating The Data Tree
- Adding New Dimensions To The Table
- Visualization Of Data
- Making a Presentation To The Employer

    ## Datasets Used

- Basic select statements (select, where, group by, having).
- Joins (inner, outer, left, right).
- String & date manipulation functions.
- Window functions (rank, lead, lag, row_number, ntile...)
